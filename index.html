      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>IT Analyst Intern | Nutrien Ag Solutions</h3>
      <p>Saskatoon, Saskatchewan | Lanigan, Saskatchewan | Vanscoy, Saskatchewan</p>
      <p>My first internship with Nutrien had me based in Saskatoon, travelling to Vanscoy and Lanigan to work at the potash sites there. While I was at these sites, I gained valuable experience while troubleshooting, installing, and observing with my co-workers. During my spare time I wrote lots of documentation on procedures and important IP’s and hostnames, which are still being used to this day. Some of the most important skills I refined while here are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Troubleshooting</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Customer Service</li>
        <li>Safety-minded</li>
        <li>Teamwork</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <p>Though I didn’t have that big of a role while at the sites, my time there was still very valuable. I got to learn what it was like to work in a team, I got to get firsthand industry experience, and when I was able to help, I made sure I did a good job. This internship laid the foundation for my developing skillset, and would be a big steppingstone in my career.</p>

      <h3>IT Analyst Intern | Nutrien Ag Solutions</h3>
      <p>Rocanville, Saskatchewan</p>
      <p>My second internship took place in Rocanville Saskatchewan, also with Nutrien. This mine was much larger than the previous mines I had worked, the IT team was tripled in size, and the site was split into two parts, as was the IT team. I worked on the “mill side” which was the main site and where the potash was processed.</p>
      <p>Rocanville’s mine is the largest Potash mine owned by Nutrien, the largest supplier of Potash in the world!</p>
      <p>I immediately had a larger role that I needed to fill, I was given more independence but also higher expectations. My first few weeks I needed to give training sessions to new summer hires (like myself) on how to work their software and get started at the company.</p>
      <p>I also would frequently be assigned tasks with little to no assistance from my supervisor. I was encouraged to struggle and problem-solve and only to ask for assistance if necessary. This would be pivotal in developing my ability to learn things quickly to satisfy the needs of the business.</p>

      <h2>Achievements (artifacts)</h2>
      <h3>Levis Parking</h3>
      <p>During my second year I was assigned to a project team where we worked in a team with our classmates to create a specific app for a client. Our app was meant to make it easy to find/reserve parking spaces in Saskatoon, it would be made for our client, Levis Tech, and it would be named “Levis Parking”.</p>
      <p>This project challenged me and my group in many ways, the first and most significant being getting off the ground. We were working with a technology very unfamiliar to us at the time, called React Native. React Native is a JavaScript library that allows you to create apps for Android and iOS using React. For the first month of our project, we made almost no progress as we could not get the technology working correctly. We eventually had to restart the entire project from scratch, using a new file layout and prioritizing a clean project, which solved the issue. This first hurdle taught me not to get too attached to my work, as all it took was a few mistakes for us to have to completely restart our project.</p>
      <p>We eventually found a rhythm and managed to deliver a product that we were all proud of. I was largely responsible for implementing the vehicle portion of our app. I created a way for our users to register their vehicles into the app, and then select which vehicle they would use to park. We got to showcase our app in a presentation in front of the industry’s leading programmers, and to all our classmates. I no longer have a copy of the project itself, but I have the video of our presentation, see below.</p>

      <h3>CrowdStrike Bug</h3>
      <p>I also got firsthand experience with a disaster scenario, being the CrowdStrike bug of 2024. A security software known as “CrowdStrike” released a faulty software update that caused a worldwide outage on millions of computers, including Nutrien ones.</p>

      <p>I was called in at 3:00AM on my day off to assist in restoring operations to the site. Around 70% of the site’s computers were down, and we had to manually go to every single one and turn them back on. Once we found a solution it wasn’t hard to revert the update, but the hard part was tracking down all the important computers. By 11:00AM we had restored access to all the high priority machines, but it would have been another month before we had completely restored access to all Nutrien’s end users.</p>
      <p>Though I do not have any physical evidence of such an event, it is unmistakable that I was present for the recovery process. And I feel I learned much more in this disaster event than I could ever learn from a project artifact.</p>

      <h3>Home Server</h3>
      <p>To streamline my digital life and expand my technical skills, I have built a home server that serves multiple purposes.</p>
      <p>It hosts a centralized file system I can use to store any important files I need, I can also send more files to it, and access said files remotely with the correct credentials.</p>
      <p>I’ve also configured several multiplayer game servers that I use to play games with my friends. This allows me to control the traffic that goes into the server, and so we don’t have to pay third parties for their services.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the server functions as a reliable backup solution for all my sensitive data and schoolwork. My laptop, home computers, and phone will periodically (once a week) send the data I specify to my server. Where it will be kept safe and ready to deploy in case my devices become corrupted.</p>
      <p>My home server has served as a fun passion project, a helpful tool, and an excellent way to refine my IT skills. I hope to work on it for many more years and add more features as I learn about them.</p>
